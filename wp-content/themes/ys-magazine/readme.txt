1. Custom features.

1.1. Front page category sections for posts.

YS Magazine is a WordPress magazine theme displaying posts from 4 different categories on its front page.

Setting the front page of the theme is straightforward. Just create a new page in your WP dashboard and assign the template "Front Page of YS-Magazine".
Then use the theme customizer to display that page as a front page of your website.

Next, you will need to choose posts from which 4 categories should display on the front page.

Navigate to the Appearance -> Customize section of your WordPress dashboard. It includes a section called Categories.
The Categories dropdown menu will allow you to change the category of the posts that display under a particular section on the front page.
Each category displays the two latest posts from a chosen category, vertically.

1.2 Soliloquy image slider

The theme also includes styles for the optional image slider Soliloquy –
a free WordPress plugin you can download from https://wordpress.org/plugins/soliloquy-lite/.
Once installed and activated, the plugin allows you to display a slider between the theme’s menu
and the aforementioned category sections. If you decide to get rid of it later,
just remove the plugin and the front page will not display the slider anymore.
